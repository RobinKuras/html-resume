<h1>The Best Movies According To Robin</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of 2024.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. About Time</h3>
<p>This movie made me laugh very much. I love a good father-son-story.</p>

<h3>2. The Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>I still have no idea what this movie is about. But they are pretty good at bowling, and Steve Buscemi is a funny man.</p>

<h3>3. Past Lives</h3>
<p>This movie was slow but cute and my girlfriend liked it a lot</p>
